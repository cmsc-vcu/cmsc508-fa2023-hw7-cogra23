1. This is the README for 508 Homework Assignment 7.

2. This is an assignment intended to get the user used to working with ddl files and running sql queries both within the ddl file and embedding them within a qmd file.

3. In order to install and run the project, the user must download python, pyenv, and poetry, as well as set up the .env file in the home directory in order to connect to the database. Once this is done, the user can render the hw7.qmd using quarto in order to view the document.
